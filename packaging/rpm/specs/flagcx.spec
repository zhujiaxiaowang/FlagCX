%changelog
* Sat Nov 01 2025 FlagOS Contributors <contact@flagos.io> - 0.7-1
- Added support to TsingMicro, including device adaptor tsmicroAdaptor and CCL adaptor tcclAdaptor.
- Implemented an experimental kernel-free non-reduce collective communication (SendRecv, AlltoAll, AlltoAllv, Broadcast, Gather, Scatter, AllGather) using device-buffer IPC/RDMA.
- Enabled auto-tuning on NVIDIA, MetaX, and Hygon platforms, achieving 1.02×–1.26× speedups for AllReduce, AllGather, ReduceScatter, and AlltoAll.
- Enhanced flagcxNetAdaptor with one-sided primitives (put, putSignal, waitValue) and added retransmission support for reliability improvement.

* Wed Oct 01 2025 FlagOS Contributors <contact@flagos.io> - 0.6-1
- Implemented device-buffer IPC communication to support intra-node SendRecv operations.
- Introduced device-initiated, host-launched device-side primitives, enabling kernel-based communication directly from devices.
- Enhanced auto-tuning with 50% performance improvement on MetaX platforms for the AllReduce operations.

* Mon Sep 01 2025 FlagOS Contributors <contact@flagos.io> - 0.5-1
- Added support for AMD GPUs, including a device adaptor hipAdaptor and a CCL adaptor rcclAdaptor.
- Introduced flagcxNetAdaptor to unify network backends, currently supporting socket, IBRC, UCX and IBUC (experimental).
- Enabled zero-copy device-buffer RDMA (user-buffer RDMA) to boost performance for small messages.
- Supported auto-tuning in homogeneous scenarios via flagcxTuner.
- Added test automation in CI/CD for PyTorch APIs.

* Fri Aug 01 2025 FlagOS Contributors <contact@flagos.io> - 0.4-1
- Supported heterogeneous training of ERNIE4.5 (Baidu) on NVIDIA and Iluvatar GPUs with Paddle + FlagCX.
- Improved heterogeneous communication across arbitrary NIC configurations, with more robust and flexible deployments.
- Introduced an experimental network plugin interface with extended supports for IBRC and SOCKET. Device buffer registration now can be done via DMA-BUF.
- Added an InterOp-level DSL to enable customized C2C algorithm design.
- Provided user documentation under docs/.

* Tue Jul 01 2025 FlagOS Contributors <contact@flagos.io> - 0.3-1
- Integrated three additional native communication libraries: HCCL (Huawei), MUSACCL (Moore Threads) and MPI.
- Enhanced heterogeneous collective communication operations with pipeline optimizations.
- Introduced device-side functions to enable device-buffer RDMA, complementing the existing host-side functions.
- Delivered a full-stack open-source solution, FlagScale + FlagCX, for efficient heterogeneous prefilling-decoding disaggregation.

* Thu May 01 2025 FlagOS Contributors <contact@flagos.io> - 0.2-1
- Integrated 3 additional native communications libraries, including MCCL (Moore Threads), XCCL (Mellanox) and DUCCL (BAAI).
- Improved 11 heterogeneous collective communication operations with automatic topology detection and full support to single-NIC and multi-NIC environments.

* Tue Apr 01 2025 FlagOS Contributors <contact@flagos.io> - 0.1-1
- Added 5 native communications libraries including CCL adaptors for NCCL (NVIDIA), IXCCL (Iluvatar), and CNCL (Cambricon), and Host CCL adaptors GLOO and Bootstrap.
- Supported 11 heterogeneous collective communication operations using the C2C (Cluster-to-Cluster) algorithm.
- Provided a full-stack open-source solution, FlagScale + FlagCX, for efficient heterogeneous training.
- Natively integrated into PaddlePaddle [v3.0.0](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle/tree/v3.0.0), with support for both dynamic and static graphs.
