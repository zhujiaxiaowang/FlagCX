## About

FlagCX is part of [FlagOS](https://flagos.io/), a fully open-source system software stack
designed to unify the model–system–chip layers and foster an open and collaborative ecosystem.
It enables a "develop once, run anywhere" workflow across diverse AI accelerators,
unlocking hardware performance, eliminating fragmentation among AI chipset-specific software stacks,
and substantially lowering the cost of porting and maintaining AI workloads.

[FlagCX](https://github.com/flagos-ai/FlagCX.git) is a scalable and adaptive cross-chip communication library.
It serves as a platform where developers, researchers, and AI engineers can collaborate on various projects,
contribute to the development of cutting-edge AI solutions, and share their work with the global community.

FlagCX leverages native collective communication libraries to provide full single-chip communication support across platforms.
Beyond its native x-CCL integrations, FlagCX introduces original _device-buffer IPC_ and _device-buffer RDMA_ technologies,
enabling high-performance P2P operations for both cross-chip and single-chip scenarios.
These mechanisms can be seamlessly combined with native x-CCL backends to deliver optimized performance
for cross-chip collective communications.

[PaddlePaddle](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/).
The table below lists the frameworks supported by FlagCX and their related communication operations,
where the `batch_XXX` and `XXX_coalesced` ops refer to the usage of group primitives.

Note that PyTorch support is enabled via the FlagCX Torch plugin, which provides native integration with the PyTorch distributed backend.
This plugin has undergone comprehensive validation across diverse communication backends and hardware platforms,
ensuring robust functionality, consistent performance, and compatibility in multi-chip heterogeneous environments.

| FlagCX Backend  | NCCL | IXCCL | CNCL | MCCL | XCCL | DUCCL | HCCL | MUSACCL | RCCL | TCCL | ECCL | PCCL |
| :-------------- | :--- | :---- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :---- | :--- | :------ | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| PyTorch Support | ✓    | ✓     | ✓    | ✓    | ✓    | ✓     | ✓    | ✓       | ✓    | ✓    |✓    |✓   |

> [!TIP]
> To enable heterogeneous cross-chip communication using the PyTorch DDP FlagCX backend,
> it is recommended to use identical PyTorch versions across all nodes.
> Mismatched versions may lead to initialization failures during process group setup.
> Helpful advice for doing things better or more easily.

### Training Models

After building and testing FlagCX, you can start training models using upper-layer deep learning frameworks
such as [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) or [PaddlePaddle](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle)
using FlagCX as the communication backend.
We provide detailed user guides for both **homogeneous** and **heterogeneous** training across different hardware platforms.
Please refer to the docs below:  

<!--TODO(Qiming): Revise the directory layout-->
- [Training Models with PyTorch and FlagCX](./docs/user_guide.md).
- [Training Models with Paddle and FlagCX](./docs/paddle/README.md).
